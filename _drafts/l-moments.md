# Intro to L-Moments
- used to calculate sample statistics for individual data sites
- used here for identifying an appropriate probability distribution
- used for finding the suitable parameters for the chosen probability distribution
- the name "L-moments" relates to their use in linear combinations
- performs better than other methods for identifying the shape of probability distribution and approximating its parameters, especially for water resource problems where the number of environmental samples taken is pretty small.
- looking at the L-moment ratio diagram can be a useful component to helping choose a statistical distribution that roughly represents the area under study

## Advantages of L-Moments over comparable techniques
- not as sensitive to distortion from outliers
- can help the analyst study more probability distributions than conventional moments
- less biased than comparable methods
- Example of where L-Moments would work really well: "estimating hydrological data in a developing country, which generally have small sample sizes"

# Equations
**Measure of Location (L1)**
  L1 = mean

**Ratio Measure of Scale (L-Cv)**
  t2 = L2/L1
  - This is an indicator of variability. It is dimensionless and lies between 0 and 1. When the magnitude of L-Cv is close to 0, it means that there is very little variation and the process is probably tightly controlled, such as production for advanced missile defense products or space gear.

**Ratio Measure of L-Skewness (t3)**
  t3 = L3/L2
  - Looking at skewness gives you an idea of the relative shape of your data. Unlike perfectly bell-shaped Gaussian data, the curve of skewed data will lean heavily to one side or the other (depending on weather it is positively or negatively skewed).

**Ratio Measure of L-Kurtosis (t4)**
  t4 = L4/L2

# Method of Moments
- use this for determining the parameters of the probability distribution for the flood frequency analysis
- the technique involves trying to match the moments from the sample to moments of common distributions (those commonly seen in flood frequency, for example)

# Conclusion
From this point, goodness-of-fit tests can help to check that the chosen probability distribution was indeed a suitable fit.
- caution: sometimes it can be hard to sift through the information generated by the third, fourth, or higher moments. That's when a technique such as <smoothing> can be useful
