Ethicists have made the case that people living in rich countries have a moral duty to give to the poor. How does this claim apply to engineers in particular, who are uniquely positioned to apply their technical skills toward tackling global poverty? If engineers do have a moral obligation to use their occupation to help the impoverished, how does this duty interact with the rights to freedom of choice and pursuit of happiness for the engineer? This paper asks if greater ability implies greater obligation.
